# Trail-Blazers
This is just a prototype of a game i started working on in college using unity's 2d engine
The basis of the games is a simple side-scrolling beat'em up with monsters attacking from the right side of the screen making their way to the town the player is trying to protect.
Possible features to be implemented:
* multiple characters and improved character selection
* multiple maps and progession system
* story mode
* boss fights 
* daily challenges
* acheivements/trophies

Things I need to fix:
* animation issues
* title screen
* character select screen
* level ending animation
*
